Infrastructure requirements:

SQL container for device database
SQL container for user and group database
SQL container(s?) for resources
Gateways for resources (?)

One managed and one unmanaged client computer for testing

Server to give device certificates to managed devices

Server for PEP:
	Accepts requests for resources
	Redirects to SSO
	Receives SSO token
	Gives green light on user and system authentication
	Receive green light from PE on user authorization	
	Fetch requested data and relay them to user
		
Server for PE:
	Waits for SSO token from PEP after user is fully authenticated
	Runs trust algorithms
	Return trusted or untrusted status


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation details:

Programming languages: Golang, Python3
RDBMS: MySQL

> 	At first, the SSO system can be replaced by a simple 
	Username/Password combination or MFA. As the project progresses, we can add 
	existing authentication tools for the SSO.

> 	The PEP cannot query resource databases directly but goes to 
  	a corresponding gateway, with administrator priviledges on said resource.(?)
> 	All servers generate logs on all actions on every request.
> 	The steps presented in the systems diagram 1-6 are repeated for 
	every single request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network architecture details:

> 	Policy Decision Points are firewalled off.
	Same for device inventory database, User and group database 
	and certificate authority, resources and their gateways.

> 	The only traffic allowed in and out of PDPs is to the PEP.
> 	The only traffic allowed in and out of resources servers is 
	to their corresponding gateway (or the PEP?).

>	CA connects to DI and issues a new certificate periodically. (?)

Stuff that would be cool to add:

Industry standard authentication and SSO integrations.
A more complicated trust algorithm for the PE. (At first: criteria-based)
Static code analysis.
IDS/IPS systems and 24/7 monitoring.
K8s deployment.
